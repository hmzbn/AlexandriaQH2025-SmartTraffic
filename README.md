# Alexandria Quantum Hackathon 2025 ‚Äì Smart Traffic Optimization

## üèÜ Hackathon Problem
This project was developed for the **Alexandria Quantum Hackathon 2025** under the challenge:  
**Smart Traffic Optimization in the New Capital ‚Äì Emergency Patient Transportation.**

### Problem Statement
An ambulance must transport **5 patients** to the hospital with the following constraints:
- The ambulance can make multiple trips.
- Maximum **3 patients per trip**.
- All patients must reach the hospital.
- Goal: **Minimize the total travel distance**.

We implemented and compared:
- **Classical brute-force optimization**  
- **Quantum QUBO-based optimization with QAOA**
